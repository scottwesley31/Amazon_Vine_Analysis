# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to perform ETL on a dataset of Amazon product reviews and then to determine the bias of Vine Reviews. SellBy, an online retailer, pays a small fee to Amazon to provide products to Amazon Vine members to review. The dataset includes reviews from all consumers; paid (Vine) and unpaid. The dataset chosen for this analysis was specific to musical instruments which can be accessed [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Musical_Instruments_v1_00.tsv.gz). The analysis evaluates if there could be five-star review bias from the Amazon Vine members in the musical instruments dataset.
